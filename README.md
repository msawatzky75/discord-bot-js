[![Marty Nightly](https://github.com/msawatzky75/discord-bot-js/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/msawatzky75/discord-bot-js/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)

## Setup

Requirements: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/), Node (v16)
OR [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

This project uses [zero-install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs), meaning you do
not have to run a separate install step. All the dependancies are already there.

1. Clone this repository.

1. Create your environment by copying the [.env.default](.env.default) file to `.env`
   and add your token and configuraton

   ```
   $ cp .env.default .env
   ```

1. Add ide helpers to your workspace:

   ```
   $ yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode
   ```

1. Build the bot using this command:

   ```
   $ yarn build
   ```

1. You're done! You can run the bot with

   ```
   $ yarn start
   ```

### Using Docker

If you choose to use docker to run the bot, you can use the following commands:

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

or if you dont want to use docker-compose:

```
$ docker build . --tag marty-bot:latest
$ docker run marty-bot:latest
```

## Development

There are some commands to help you develop the bot:

1. To rebuild the bot every time you save a file:

   ```
   $ yarn watch
   ```

1. To start the development server, and restart it every time you save a file:

   ```
   $ yarn dev
   ```

# First Time Setup

In order for the slash commands to work, they need to be registered before
the bot can process them. This is handled by the

```
$ yarn register
```

command. this only needs to be run once, and once evertime you add, remove,
or update command names and descriptions.

or in docker: 
```
$ docker exec marty yarn register
```
